### Welcome the my first installment project of the **data analysis with python** certification issued by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator)


Creating a function named **calculate()** in *mean_var_std.py* that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix, to expand upon this project it will be generalized to work with an n x m matrix.
